# Elm-Asteroids

A simple Asteroids-like video game written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).

You can play it directly on your web browser
[here](http://rawgit.com/pbv/elm-asteroids/master/html/elm-asteroids.html).

Intended to teach functional reactive programming principles,
so very basic:

* use arrow keys to move ship and space key to fire
* alternatively, use touch controls:
   - lower left and right to steer
   - upper left to move forward, upper right to fire
* auto-firing laser (once a second)
* no colision detection between ship and asteroids!
